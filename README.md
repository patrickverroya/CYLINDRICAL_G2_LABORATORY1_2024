# **ABSTRACT**

A **CYLINDRICAL MANIPULATOR** is a type of robot arm that is designed to function in a cylindrical workspace. This type of manipulator consists of three links (one prismatics and two revolute) arranged in a cylindrical configuration (RPP). The circular work envelope of the robots is made possible via a rotating shaft and an extensible arm that slides and travels vertically. The cylindrical manipulator has several industrial uses, including pick-and-place operations, painting, and welding. Its workspace, however, is constrained to a cylindrical cylinder and it would not be appropriate for applications requiring great precision or substantial payloads.

# **INTRODUCTION**
**CYLINDRICAL MANIPULATORS** are unique options for simple
applications that require a compact automation
solution. Their slender frame and compact design allow
for minimal workspace intrusion. Cylindrical robots are
found in a wide variety of industries. The common
application of it is packaging, material handling,
palletization, simple welding and dispensing.
There are three axes or degrees of freedom in the
cylindrical robot. They have a straightforward
mechanical design with a single rotational axis for
rotation at the base and two linear axes for height
control and arm extension with an end-effector. The
number of motors within a robot is correlated with each
axis of a cylindrical manipulator. This offers the
adaptability required to use robots to automate
numerous industrial operations. The cylindrical
manipulator is made up of rigid links joined together by
joints. The manipulator has one end that is attached to
a base and the other that is free to be employed for
various robotic tasks. 

# **DEGREES OF FREEDOM**
The number of independent variables used to
represent the various positions or motions of a
mechanical system in space is referred to as degrees
of freedom (DOF) in mechanics. The number of degrees
of freedom is equal to the total number of independent
displacements or motion characteristics.

**This will be the basis of the type of mechanical manipulator based on number of DOF of cylindrical manipulator.**
- **Under-actuated Manipulator**
     
  Either a Spatial Manipulator w/ less than 6-DOF or a
  Planar Manipulator w/ less than 3-DOF.
- **Ideal Manipulator**
  
   Either a Spatial Manipulator w/ exactly 6-DOF or a
   Planar Manipulator w/ exactly 3-DOF.
- **Redundant Manipulator**
  
    Either a Spatial Manipulator w/ more than 6-DOF or a
    Planar Manipulator w/ more than 3-DOF
