# **ABSTRACT**

A CYLINDRICAL MANIPULATOR is a type of robot arm that is designed to function in a cylindrical workspace. This type of manipulator consists of three links (one prismatics and two revolute) arranged in a cylindrical configuration (RPP). The circular work envelope of the robots is made possible via a rotating shaft and an extensible arm that slides and travels vertically. The cylindrical manipulator has several industrial uses, including pick-and-place operations, painting, and welding. Its workspace, however, is constrained to a cylindrical cylinder and it would not be appropriate for applications requiring great precision or substantial payloads.
